general_1,Can I get surgery on the NHS?,Yes. If your condition meets NHS criteria you can get treatment on the NHS for free. You'll be referred by your GP or specialist. The wait is typically 11-20 weeks depending on the procedure and location.,general,general
general_2,Is private surgery better quality?,Usually the same quality. Many private surgeons are the same consultants who work for the NHS. The difference is mainly speed (1-2 weeks vs 11-20 weeks) and comfort (private room vs shared ward). The actual surgery quality is similar.,general,general
general_3,What does the private cost include?,"Usually includes: surgeon's fee, anaesthetist, hospital stay, standard implant/lens, initial follow-up. Usually NOT included: pre-op tests (£200-500 extra), post-op physiotherapy, treatment of complications, additional follow-ups after 6 weeks.",general,general
general_4,Can I get private surgery faster if I'm in pain?,"Yes. Many private clinics can offer surgery within 1-2 weeks. Some urgent cases within days. Tell the clinic you're in significant pain—they often prioritise such cases. You may need to pay a deposit upfront.",general,general
general_5,What if I can't afford private?,"NHS is free and will treat you—you just wait longer. Options include: payment plans at private clinics (many offer 0% interest for 12-24 months), check if you have forgotten insurance through work/unions, ask about self-pay discounts (often 10-20% off).",general,general
general_6,Is there a risk I'm a 'bad candidate' for surgery?,"Your surgeon will assess at consultation. Age alone is rarely a barrier—many patients in their 80s and 90s have successful surgeries. Key factors: overall health, mobility, weight, other conditions (diabetes, heart disease). Most people over 65 are good candidates.",general,general
general_7,How do I choose which clinic?,"Ask these questions: Is the surgeon on the GMC specialist register? How many of these procedures have they done? What's their complication rate? Which implant brands do they use? Visit 2-3 clinics to compare—consultations are usually £150-250.",general,general
general_8,Do I need health insurance for private?,"No, you can self-pay. About 70% of private patients pay directly. If you have insurance (Bupa, AXA, Vitality etc), check if you're covered—many policies exclude pre-existing conditions. Self-pay is often simpler with transparent pricing.",general,general
general_9,Can I switch from NHS to private during my wait?,"Yes, you can go private anytime without losing your NHS place. Some people have private consultation (£150-250) to get diagnosed faster, then return to NHS for surgery. You can also have surgery privately and keep NHS for follow-up care.",general,general
general_10,What if my NHS surgery gets cancelled?,"NHS cancellations are common (15-20% of surgeries). If cancelled, you should be rebooked within 28 days. After 2 cancellations, you can request referral to another hospital. Consider going private if delays are affecting your quality of life.",general,general
general_11,Do I need a GP referral for private surgery?,"Most private hospitals prefer a GP referral letter (your GP provides this free). Some clinics accept self-referral for consultations. If self-referring, you may need to pay for all diagnostic tests. Getting a GP referral is usually simpler.",general,general
general_12,Can I choose my surgeon?,"NHS: Limited choice—you get whoever is available. You can request but not guaranteed. Private: Yes, you choose your specific surgeon and can research their experience. This is a major advantage of going private.",general,general
cataract_1,Can I get cataract surgery on the NHS?,"Yes, if cataracts affect your daily life (driving, reading, recognising faces). NHS waiting times are currently 11-19 weeks depending on location. Your optician or GP will refer you. Both eyes are done separately, usually 6-12 weeks apart.",cataract,procedure
cataract_2,What type of lens will I get?,"NHS: Standard monofocal lens (free)—you'll need glasses for either distance or reading. Private: Choice of premium lenses—multifocal (see all distances, £800-1500 extra per eye), toric (corrects astigmatism, £500-800 extra). Discuss options with your surgeon.",cataract,procedure
cataract_3,Is the surgery painful?,"No. Done under local anaesthetic (eye drops), you're awake but feel no pain. Takes 15-30 minutes. Most patients say it's easier than going to the dentist. You can go home the same day.",cataract,procedure
cataract_4,How quickly will my vision improve?,"Most people notice improvement within 24-48 hours. Full healing takes 4-6 weeks. You'll need new glasses prescription after healing. Don't drive until your surgeon confirms it's safe (usually after 1-2 weeks).",cataract,procedure
cataract_5,What are the main risks?,"Very safe procedure with 95%+ success rate. Risks include: infection (1 in 1000), retinal detachment (1 in 500), posterior capsule rupture (1 in 100). Your surgeon will explain all risks. Most complications are treatable.",cataract,procedure
cataract_6,Can both eyes be done together?,"NHS: No, usually 6-12 weeks apart for safety. Private: Some clinics offer both eyes same day (additional cost) but most surgeons prefer 2-4 weeks gap. Doing separately is safer if complications arise.",cataract,procedure
hip_1,How long is hip replacement recovery?,"Hospital stay: 1-3 days. Walking with frame/crutches: immediately. Walking unaided: 6 weeks. Driving: 6-8 weeks. Full recovery: 3-6 months. Most people are back to normal activities within 3 months. Physiotherapy is essential.",hip,procedure
hip_2,What are the main risks?,"Major surgery but generally safe. Risks: infection (1-2%), blood clots (1-3%), dislocation (2-3%), leg length difference (5%). Your age and health affect risk levels. Surgeon will discuss your personal risk factors.",hip,procedure
hip_3,How long do hip replacements last?,"Modern hip replacements last 15-20 years for 90% of patients. Younger, more active patients may need revision sooner. Ceramic and titanium implants may last longer. After 20 years, about 15% need revision surgery.",hip,procedure
hip_4,Can I return to sports after hip replacement?,"Low-impact activities (swimming, cycling, golf, walking) are encouraged after 3 months. High-impact sports (running, football, tennis) are usually discouraged as they wear out the implant faster. Discuss with your surgeon.",hip,procedure
hip_5,What type of anaesthetic is used?,"Usually spinal anaesthetic (awake but numb from waist down) plus sedation. Some patients have general anaesthetic. Spinal is often preferred for older patients as recovery is quicker. Your anaesthetist will discuss options.",hip,procedure
hip_6,Will I set off metal detectors?,"Yes, modern hip implants usually trigger airport metal detectors. Carry a card or letter from your hospital confirming your implant. Security staff are familiar with this. It's not a problem, just takes a few extra minutes.",hip,procedure
knee_1,How long is knee replacement recovery?,"Hospital stay: 1-3 days. Walking with frame/crutches: immediately. Walking unaided: 6 weeks. Driving: 6-8 weeks. Full recovery: 3-6 months but knee may feel stiff for up to a year. Physiotherapy is crucial.",knee,procedure
knee_2,What are the main risks?,"Similar to hip replacement. Risks: infection (1-2%), blood clots (1-3%), stiffness (5-10%), ongoing pain (10-20%). Knee replacement has slightly higher dissatisfaction rate than hip (about 20% have some ongoing discomfort).",knee,procedure
knee_3,How long do knee replacements last?,"Modern knee replacements last 15-20 years for 85% of patients. After 20 years, about 20% need revision. Partial knee replacements may not last as long. Weight and activity level affect longevity.",knee,procedure
knee_4,Is knee replacement more painful than hip?,"Recovery is generally more challenging than hip replacement. More swelling and stiffness. Pain typically worse for first 6 weeks. Good pain management and physiotherapy are essential. Most patients say it's worth it long-term.",knee,procedure
knee_5,Can I kneel after knee replacement?,"About 50% of patients can kneel comfortably after full recovery. Others find it uncomfortable but not harmful. Use knee pads if needed. Ability to kneel improves over the first year. Not being able to kneel doesn't mean the surgery failed.",knee,procedure
knee_6,Should I have partial or total knee replacement?,"Depends on your arthritis pattern. Partial (only replaces damaged part): smaller incision, quicker recovery, more natural feeling, but only suitable for 25% of patients. Total (replaces whole joint): more predictable, longer lasting. Surgeon will advise based on X-rays.",knee,procedure
