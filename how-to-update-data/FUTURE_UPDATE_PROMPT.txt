# CompareTheWait NHS Data Quarterly Update - [INSERT DATE]

## PROJECT CONTEXT

You're helping update the NHS waiting times database for **CompareTheWait**, a UK healthcare comparison website. This is a **quarterly data refresh** to ensure patients have current, accurate information.

**Previous Update:** November 2025 (deployed version 3)

## YOUR MISSION

Update patient-reported NHS waiting times with the latest data, replacing outdated estimates with real patient submissions where possible, and re-validating all statistical estimates.

## PHASE 1: UNDERSTAND CURRENT STATE

I'm attaching the following files from production:
- `nhs_waits_v3_with_estimates.csv` (current production data)
- `ESTIMATION_METHODOLOGY.txt` (how estimates were calculated)
- `EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY_v3.txt` (project overview)

**First, please:**
1. Read all three files to understand the current data structure
2. Identify which values are ESTIMATED vs REAL patient data
3. List the 4 estimated values that need priority replacement:
   - Leeds Hip Replacement (currently 50 weeks - estimated)
   - Leeds Knee Replacement (currently 78 weeks - estimated)
   - Birmingham Knee Replacement (currently 65 weeks - estimated)
   - Bristol Knee Replacement (currently 44 weeks - estimated)

## PHASE 2: DATA COLLECTION STRATEGY

### Priority 1: Replace Estimated Values with Real Data

**Search Strategy for Patient-Reported Wait Times:**

Search these sources for REAL patient experiences in Leeds, Birmingham, and Bristol:

1. **Patient Forums** (search for posts from last 6 months):
   - Reddit UK: r/NHS, r/AskUK, r/unitedkingdom
   - Patient.co.uk forum (Hip/Knee Replacement sections)
   - BoneSmart.org (UK hip/knee replacement forum)
   - Care Opinion (careadvice.org.uk)
   - HealthUnlocked forums

   Search queries:
   - "Leeds hip replacement wait time 2025"
   - "Birmingham knee replacement how long"
   - "Bristol knee surgery waiting list"
   - "NHS [city] orthopaedic wait"

2. **NHS Trust Official Data**:
   - My Planned Care website (myplannedcare.nhs.uk)
   - Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust updates
   - University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust
   - University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust
   - Search each trust's website for "patient wait times" or "referral to treatment"

3. **News Sources** (last 3-6 months):
   - BBC News regional sections (Yorkshire, West Midlands, South West)
   - Local newspapers: Yorkshire Post, Birmingham Mail, Bristol Post
   - Search: "[city] NHS waiting times 2025" or "orthopaedic backlog [city]"

4. **FOI Requests Results**:
   - WhatDoTheyKnow.com (search for recent FOI responses)
   - NHS England statistics portal
   - Search: "waiting times [trust name]"

5. **Social Media**:
   - Twitter/X: Search "#NHS + Leeds/Birmingham/Bristol + hip/knee"
   - Facebook: Local community health groups

**Data Quality Criteria:**
- Prefer data from last 6 months (most recent)
- Need minimum 8-12 verified patient reports per procedure/city
- Cross-reference multiple sources
- Exclude obvious outliers (e.g., 1 week or 200 weeks)
- Document confidence level: HIGH (12+ sources), MEDIUM (6-11 sources), LOW (3-5 sources)

### Priority 2: Validate Existing Real Data

For the 11 REAL patient-reported values (London, Manchester, Birmingham, Bristol cataracts and hip/knee), verify they're still accurate:

**Search for updates:**
- "London cataract waiting time 2025"
- "Manchester ACES fast track cataract"
- "Birmingham cataract surgery wait"
- Same for hip/knee procedures

**If data changed significantly (>20% difference):**
- Update with new average
- Document the change in report
- Note confidence level

### Priority 3: Update UK-Wide Averages

Search for latest national statistics:
- NHS England official statistics (england.nhs.uk/statistics)
- "NHS waiting times Q[X] 2025 report"
- "Referral to Treatment (RTT) statistics"
- Royal College of Surgeons reports
- British Orthopaedic Association statements

**Look for:**
- National median wait times for cataract, hip, knee
- Regional variations (London, Midlands, Yorkshire, South West)
- Any major policy changes (e.g., new fast-track schemes)

## PHASE 3: DATA ANALYSIS & VALIDATION

Once you've collected new data, perform:

### Statistical Validation

For each updated value:
1. Calculate median and mean from patient reports
2. Remove outliers (beyond 2 standard deviations)
3. Compare to previous estimate/value
4. Document percentage change
5. Assign confidence level

### Comparative Analysis

Create table comparing OLD vs NEW:

| City | Procedure | OLD (Nov 2025) | NEW ([date]) | Change | Data Type | Confidence |
|------|-----------|----------------|--------------|--------|-----------|------------|
| Leeds | hip | 50 weeks (EST) | [NEW] weeks | +/- X% | REAL/EST | HIGH/MED/LOW |

### Quality Checks

- Are new values within reasonable range? (5-120 weeks)
- Do regional patterns still make sense? (e.g., ACES centres faster)
- Any unexplained dramatic changes (>50%)? Document why.
- Cross-reference with official NHS data

## PHASE 4: DOCUMENTATION & DELIVERABLES

### Required Outputs

1. **Updated CSV File**: `nhs_waits_v4_[date].csv`
   - Same structure as v3
   - Updated patient_reported_wait_weeks
   - Flag estimated values

2. **Change Report**: `DATA_UPDATE_REPORT_v4.txt`
   Include:
   - Summary of changes (X values updated, Y estimates replaced)
   - Detailed table: OLD vs NEW comparison
   - Confidence levels for each value
   - Data sources used (with URLs)
   - Methodology changes (if any)
   - Recommendations for next update

3. **Updated Methodology**: `ESTIMATION_METHODOLOGY_v4.txt`
   - Update UK-wide averages section
   - Add new data sources discovered
   - Refine estimation formulas if needed
   - Document any new regional patterns

4. **Executive Summary**: `UPDATE_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY_v4.txt`
   - High-level changes (for management)
   - Impact on user experience
   - Data quality improvements
   - Recommendations for product team

### Format for Updated Values

For each changed value, document like this:

```
LEEDS - HIP REPLACEMENT
Previous: 50 weeks (ESTIMATED, Nov 2025)
Updated: 47 weeks (REAL, [date])
Change: -6% (improved)
Confidence: MEDIUM
Sources:
- Patient.co.uk forum: 12 reports, avg 45 weeks (Jan-Mar 2025)
- BoneSmart UK: 8 reports, avg 48 weeks (Feb-Mar 2025)
- Reddit r/NHS: 5 reports, avg 49 weeks (Jan-Feb 2025)
Calculation: Median of 25 reports = 47 weeks
Note: Replaced estimate with real patient data ✓
```

## PHASE 5: VALIDATION CHECKLIST

Before finalizing:

Data Integrity:
☐ All 15 rows have patient_reported_wait_weeks filled
☐ No values below 3 weeks or above 120 weeks
☐ Regional patterns make sense (ACES centres still fast?)
☐ All sources documented with URLs and dates
☐ Confidence levels assigned to all values

Quality:
☐ Minimum 8 sources for any REAL data designation
☐ Estimates clearly flagged if real data unavailable
☐ Cross-referenced with official NHS statistics
☐ Outliers removed with justification

Documentation:
☐ Change report complete with OLD vs NEW table
☐ All sources cited properly
☐ Methodology updated if needed
☐ Executive summary suitable for non-technical stakeholders
☐ Recommendations for next quarter provided

## PHASE 6: RECOMMENDATIONS

After analysis, provide:

1. **Immediate Actions**: Which estimated values should be updated now?
2. **Data Gaps**: Where do we still need more patient data?
3. **Collection Strategy**: Best channels to get missing data next quarter
4. **Methodology Improvements**: Any refinements to estimation formulas?
5. **Timeline**: Recommend next update date (typically 3 months)

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

Your update is successful if:
✓ At least 1-2 estimated values replaced with real data
✓ All existing real data validated or updated
✓ UK-wide averages refreshed from latest NHS statistics
✓ Confidence levels improved or maintained
✓ All changes documented with clear sources
